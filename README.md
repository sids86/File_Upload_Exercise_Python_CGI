# File_Upload_Exercise_Python_CGI
A basic exercise to select and upload a file on to the server using Python CGI.

Note:- -> The first line (#!/Python27/python) in the file check_box_action.py shoudl be changed to the path where Python is installed on your respective machine. On my machine, its installed at C:\Python27.

-> The folder structure i.e. cgi-bin and htdocs need to be maintained within the Apache (the server in my case) installation folder. HTML files shoudl be placed ins ide htdocs and Python files shoudl be placed inside cgi-bin.

-> These files need to be executed on the server, which can be localhost if you are running the program on local machine.
